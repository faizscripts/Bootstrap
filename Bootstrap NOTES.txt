///         BREAKPOINTS         ///

sm  -   >=576px
md  -   >=768px
lg  -   >=992px
xl  -   >=1200px
xxl -   >=1400px


/// DISPLAY ATTRIBUTE           ///
this can be used by the display property to hide items


there are 2 ways of using it

1.  d-{value}
this is for xs i.e it applies to xs and above
where value can be none, inline, flex etc


2.  d-{breakpoint}-{value}
this applies to sm, md, lg and xl as xs is catered for in number 1
breakpoint is the breakpoint value



~ d-none d-sm-block
hide something on xs


a meter used to show the current screen size
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Current breakpoint is:
            <span class="d-inline d-sm-none text-danger">XS</span>
            <span class="d-none d-sm-inline d-md-none text-warning">SM</span>

//?????? QUESTION ?????? padding of 3 all round
//?????? QUESTION ?????? top and bottom margin of 5
//?????? QUESTION ?????? the default margin should be 2, when the screen gets to medium the padding should be 3, lg 4 and xl 5

















///     MARGIN & PADDING            ///



property-sides-size for xs      -   mt-5, p-3
property/sides-breakpoint-size for the rest    - p-sm-4, mt-lg-1



property
m       - margin
p       - padding


sides
t       - top
b       - bottom
l       - left
r       - right
x       - left and right
y       - top and bottom
(blank) - all round


size
0       - no m/ p
1       - 0.25 rem
2       - 0.5 rem
auto    - auto

px-5    - padding left and right is 5 = 3rems




we can also use this at responsive breakpoints say you have a grid and you want the margin/ padding to change according to the screen size

m-2 m-md-3 m-lg-4 m-xl-5

m2 is the normal margin




















//?????? QUESTION ?????? what give an input tag form properties
//?????? QUESTION ?????? create a form with a large input for email, range, file selecting and a submit button












///         FORM CONTROLS & FORM GROUP          ///




.form-control is the class used to give bootstrap  form properties to an input


    <form>
        <label for="email">Email</label>
        <input id="email" type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter your email">
    </form>


the for attribute in the label tag helps us to link it with the input tag if the for value is equal to the input tag's id



.form-group is the easiest way to add some structure to forms.

it's used to group say input tag pairs with their labels


    <form>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="email">Email</label>
            <input id="email" type="email" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter your email">
        </div>
        <div>
            <label for="pass">Password</label>
            <input id="pass" type="password" class="form-control" placeholder="Password">
        </div>
    </form>





you can also use form control for different sizes

.form-control-lg

.form control-sm


theres also a special form control for file and range to give it better styling

.form-control-file

.form-control-range














//?????? QUESTION ?????? create an inline radio which asks for your gender. Note a radio should only be able to select one item












/// CHECKBOXES AND RADIO BUTTONS            ///



use a special class called form-check for each individual checkbox or radio


.form-check-input       - each input

.form-check-label       - each label


    <form >
        <div class="form-check">
            <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="male">
            <label for="male">Male</label>
        </div>

        <div class="form-check">
            <input type="checkbox" class="form-check-input" id="female" disabled>
            <label for="female">Female</label>
        </div>

        <div class="form-check">
            <input type="radio" class="form-radio-input" id="radio">
            <label for="radio">Radio</label>

        </div>
    </form>



for radios, they should have the same name so that you can only select one from the list



<div class="form-check form-check-inline"></div>

an inline form check

//?????? QUESTION ?????? create an input tag for username and password. they should have icons attached to the input tags

.input-group-prepend        - add something at the beginning

.input-group-append         - add something at the end


        <form>
            <div class="input-group mb-3">
                <div class="input-group-prepend">
                    <span class="input-group-text">

        <a href="#" class="nav-link"></a>

            <a href="#" class="nav-link disabled"></a>
        </nav>












///         NAVBARS         ///


.navbar-light            - dark text


.navbar-dark             - light text



Always collapsed navbar

















///         BOOTSTRAP GRID          ///



in order to use the bg, you need to place everything inside a container whether its a normal container or container-fluid


within the container, we will look up at 2 more classes

1. row - for content which goes across the container then you can divide it using columns


each row has 12 units of space and we can specify the space for each column

the default without specifying the width is that the columns are divided equally


in order to make a responsive layout design, we will have to focus on the small sizes


NOTE: there is no col-xs-12, the default is already xs i.e col-12


this means we can do the responsive styling sm upwards and the columns will be stacked by default in the xs screen













///         GRID ALIGNMENT          ///


it uses similar classes of alignment like flexbox


the default for aligning items vertically is stretch where all the columns in the will take the height of the largest column


the default for horizonal alignment is justify-content-start





///         OFFSET AND NESTING          ///


sometimes you may have content that doesn't do all the way across and you may want something that doesn't start at the beginning

offset-md-1
this is also responsive and means the offset will go away below md



we can also nest grids i.e inside a column you can add another row






///         FORM AND GRID           ///



there is a special class called form-row which is used when styling forms using the grid system





















///         LIST GROUPS         ///


list view is a way of displaying a series of content


the easiest way is creating ul with the class list-group and li with the class list-group-item


if you want actionable list items use the class list-group-item-action on top of the list-group-item



.list-group-flush
minimalistic lines













///         CARDS               ///


a div with the class card

inside it a div with the class card body


it automatically gives a border


you can use cards with images in 3 ways
1. card-img-top         image above text
2. card-img-bottom      image below text
3. card-img then add a div with card-img-overlay instead of card-body
   image overlay i.e text above image













you can use the bootstrap grid to arrange cards. However there's also a built in class to arrange cards


however, at the moment card layouts are not entirely responsive


.card-group
    .card


.card-deck
    .card
you can also use card deck instead of card group with the difference being that the cards aren't attached



.card-columns
give the masonry style which places elements in optimal positions based on available vertical space

for card columns you can use css to specify the number of columns you want








///         BADGES          ///


often used for counting notifications

h3
    span   .badge .badge-primary



you can also use it inside a button

button
    span    .badge badge-light



you can also use pill edges which makes the badges rounded






///         BREADCRUMBS         ///

 indicates the current page location within a navigational hierarchy that automatically adds separators via css


 like the file explorer in windows

 home  /  library  /  data




 ///            BUTTON GROUP            ///

 group of bootstrap button combined to a single line


 .btn-group     .btn







 ///            PAGINATION          ///



 used for page navigation




///         PROGRESS BAR            ///



used to show some meter or level or something



.progress   - entire range
.progress-bar - length

you can also use a label

you can also change the color e.g bg-success

.progress-bar-stripped

.progress-bar-animated
