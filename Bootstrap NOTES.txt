aim to modify your page e.g not using all the defaults like color and fonts in order to have a personal touch


container wraps our content and enables it to use the bootstrap grid


buttons were designed to work with button tags but they can work with a and input tags as well



///         TYPOGRAPHY          ///

other than the normal heading tags, you can include h1 etc as a class to give the item h1 properties


there exist a small tag which makes the text small. you can use it together with the class text-muted to create fancy headings



-display-1 to display-4
a larger slightly more opinionated heading. also works in other tags


-lead
makes a paragraph stand out more font size and weight


-inline text elements
mark- highlights text
del/ s-    strikethrough










///         BREAKPOINTS         ///

this can be used by the display property to hide items


there are 2 ways of using it

1.  d-{value}
this is for xs i.e it applies to xs and above
where value can be none, inline, flex etc


2.  d-{breakpoint}-{value}
this applies to sm, md, lg and xl as xs is catered for in number 1
breakpoint is the breakpoint value



~ d-none d-sm-block
hide something on xs


a meter used to show the current screen size
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Current breakpoint is:
            <span class="d-inline d-sm-none text-danger">XS</span>

b       - bottom
l       - left
r       - right

we can also use this at responsive breakpoints say you have a grid and you want the margin/ padding to change according to the screen size
